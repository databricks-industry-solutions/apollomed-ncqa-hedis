## Scalable, In-House Quality Measurement with an NCQA-Certified Engine
Quality measurement is a core component of value-based care contracting. Unfortunately, data regarding quality performance are typically delivered via diversely-formatted Excel spreadsheets, acquired from various payors in non-automated ways. A recent industry shift has led to a consolidation of the data sources underlying quality metrics in *curated delta lakes*, often with comparatively stable ingestions on industry standard formats. For the first time, *it is possible for many organizations to measure their quality performance daily, at scale, using internal data sources.* The ApolloMed Velox Quality engine facilitates this use case, allowing certified HEDIS measures to be executed in parallel with a simple to use python library, `chedispy` (certified-hedispy).

In this solution accelerator, we illustrate how to use the ApolloMed Velox Quality engine to:
1. `01-member-sample`: Generate a [HEDIS-certified HBD](https://www.ncqa.org/hedis/measures/comprehensive-diabetes-care/) measure result based on a simple JSON data source
2. `02-scalable-processing`: Apply the quality engine to a larger record-set and analyze the results

## Chedispy (Certified HEDISÂ® Measures)

### Installation
If you're interested in purchasing the Apollomed Velox Quality engine for use internally, please reach out to [da_sales@apollomed.net](mailto:da_sales@apollomed.net). If you have already contracted with ApolloMed, you will receive a python wheel file which can be installed as a [library on Databricks clusters](https://docs.databricks.com/en/libraries/cluster-libraries.html). All `chedispy` dependencies will be installed during wheel installation.

### Usage
1. Transform internal data sources `chedispy` input format (JSON). Find an exhaustive formatting guide [here](https://ameh.notion.site/ameh/ApolloMed-Quality-Engine-Documentation-3250d28383fa4a3a9cf7eab6b41296ce)
2. Import a specific measure engine.
3. Apply the `get_measure` method to member data.

```
from chedispy.load_engine import load_engine
engine = load_engine(measure="HBD")
res = engine.get_measure(
    member=member_data
)
```

### Data Sources
`member_data` is represented as JSON and is assumed to be a combination of the following sources. Find an exhaustive formatting guide [here](https://ameh.notion.site/ameh/ApolloMed-Quality-Engine-Documentation-3250d28383fa4a3a9cf7eab6b41296ce)
