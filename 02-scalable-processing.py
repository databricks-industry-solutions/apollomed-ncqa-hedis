# MAGIC In this notebook, we run `read-sample` which duplicates our original member from `01-member-sample` with some randomized attributes. We then illustrate how to run the `HBD` via a Spark UDF. Using a UDF facilitates scaling to as many measure, measure year combinations as necessary.

# MAGIC `chedispy` returns an array of results for two possible reasons:
# MAGIC - A measure may have multiple submeasures (measure_id). For instance, poorly controlled and well-controlled
# MAGIC - A member may have result for multiple payers. For example many measures are reportable to both Medicaid and Medicare.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC With results written to the `member_measure` table, it's simple to aggregate in SQL, or any downstream BI reporting tool.

# MAGIC - Race and Ethnicity variables do not correspond to realistic distribution
# MAGIC - Since a single member may be reportable to multiple payers, *group by's are not mutually exclusive or summable*
